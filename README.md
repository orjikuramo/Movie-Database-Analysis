# Movie-Database-Analysis

This SQL Analysis covers carefully selected movies produced over a period of Ninety-Six (96) years, between 1920 to 2016. The raw dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

In this SQL project, I cleaned, analysed and presented the Movie data table using the following tools; Excel, Notepad++, Visual Studio, SQL and Power Bi (visualisation).

The Movie data was available as a CSV file, a duplicate was created, moved to another folder, converted to Txt file and uploaded to Excel. This was to ensure the data in each cell were not truncated or opened to error, which is usually common with numbers in CSV when opened with Excel. In Excel, i removed duplicated rows, then proceeded to converting each column to the appropriate data type (text, numbers or date)

I performed automated data cleaning techniques using Conditional Split in Visual Studio, Since our analysis focused on finance, rows without Gross, Budget, Movie Title and Directors Name were automatically excluded into a TXT file and kept in a folder.

SQL was used in analysisng the dataset.
